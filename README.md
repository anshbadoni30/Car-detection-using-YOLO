The **"Autonomous Driving - Car Detection using YOLO"** project involves implementing object detection in the context of autonomous driving. The main goal of this project is to use the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to accurately detect cars in images. Here's a summary of the key components and concepts covered:

### Key Components:
1. **YOLO Model Overview**:
   - YOLO is an efficient object detection model that processes images in a single pass, making it suitable for real-time applications like autonomous driving.
   - The model divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell.

2. **Dataset and Problem Statement**:
   - The project is focused on detecting cars in images, which is essential for autonomous driving systems to identify vehicles on the road.

3. **Model Details**:
   - **Model Architecture**: The project explores the architecture of YOLO, which includes convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities.
   - **Class Score Thresholding**: A threshold is applied to filter out low-confidence predictions, retaining only the most likely car detections.

4. **Non-Max Suppression (NMS)**:
   - NMS is implemented to handle overlapping bounding boxes by retaining the most confident prediction while suppressing others, ensuring that each car is detected only once.

5. **Intersection Over Union (IoU)**:
   - IoU is used to measure the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes, which helps in refining the detection accuracy.

6. **Running YOLO on Test Images**:
   - The project includes testing the pre-trained YOLO model on new images, where it predicts and draws bounding boxes around detected cars.

7. **Results and Analysis**:
   - The output includes images with bounding boxes around detected cars, demonstrating the model's ability to perform object detection in real-time scenarios.
